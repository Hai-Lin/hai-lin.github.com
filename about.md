This is Hai, a programmer always building things. Now I live in New York and work at <a href ='http://www.theladders.com'  target="_blank">TheLadders.com</a> as a <a href = 'http://dev.theladders.com/ourteam/' target='_blank'>software engineer</a>. I graduated from <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/' target='_blank'> Columbia University</a> with a master's degree in computer science in 2012. Before that, I studied physics in <a href='http://www2012.xmu.edu.cn/english/index.asp' target='_blank'>Xiamen University</a>. 

I code in Ruby (mostly Rails), C++ (Computer Graphics), Objective-C (iOS and Mac), Java (OK,
who doesn't), Javascript (both in Node and browsers), also a bit of go and <a href='https://github.com/Hai-Lin/etudes-for-erlang' target='_blank'>Erlang</a> (for the sake of concurrency).
